            <h2>Why We Started Teaching ?</h2>
<p>We started teaching as an experimental service during Covid-2020. </p>

 <p>We have received great reviews and more are inquiring for courses.</p>




<p>We have seen people are giving more than $1000 for coding courses which we think is too expensive and education should be affordable because it is the fundamental to development and growth. Many are learning from YouTube, and various other places. There’s nothing bad in that but the way is pathless and it is easier to deviate. </p>




<p>Everyone has their own background of knowledge and one thing which they choose themselves is path. They navigate from one video to another and most find themselves nowhere. Mentorship is necessary to achieve your goals in the shortest time and I think it’s also productive.</p>




<p>We offer online classes which is live and student can interact with the mentor unlike pre-recorded videos. Our courses are project based not slide based. </p>

 
<p>We teach industry-based code not class code.</p>
